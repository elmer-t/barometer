# Barometer using Raspberry Pico, Pico-OLED1.3 display and BMP280 sensor
Barometer / temperature display using a Raspberry Pico (2), OLED 1.3 display and BMP280 sensor.
The display features 24h history graphs of both temperature and barometric pressure. Especially the latter helps predict weather and can warn for approaching storms or severe conditions. A fast drop in pressure is usually an indicator that weather is getting bad in the near future.

## Features
- Real-time barometric pressure readings
- Temperature display
- High-resolution OLED display
- Compatible with Raspberry Pico
- Uses BMP280 sensor for accurate measurements
- Customizable display options
- Data logging capabilities
- Open-source code available
- Ideal for weather monitoring and educational projects
